#This is super cool.

I now just dried out this Git CMS which is a Chrome extension that helps me create content inside of my Astro page so I don't have to go out and build in a third-party CMS or put it on another hosting platform. It's completely self-contained so I have almost zero cost to run this.

Now I just have to figure out better ways to organize the posts since that'll give me a chance to then create more information that will be helpful in my blog. 

- Bullet **One** 
- Bullet Two 
- Bullet Three 
- Bullet Four
- Bullet Five 
If I choose to do that I will also probably need to just figure out a way to maybe add pages since that might be a good way to do this or maybe use the blog for case studies and things of that nature so that the page is far more relevant based around my needs rather than a blog per se.
