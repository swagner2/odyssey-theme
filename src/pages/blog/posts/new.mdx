Building My First Blog with Astro: Early Thoughts & Next Steps

Hey everybody! 👋

This is my very first post on a new website I’m building using the Astro web framework. I wanted to see what would happen if I simply created a post and shared some thoughts as I go. No polish—just real-time reflections.

Why Astro?

Astro caught my attention because it’s blazingly fast, clean, and refreshingly simple. As someone whose business doesn’t depend on flashy animations or heavy interactivity, performance and ease of use matter much more to me. I don’t need bells and whistles—I need something reliable that loads quickly and lets me focus on the content.

Realization: I Need a CMS

As I started drafting this post, it became clear that I’ll eventually want a lightweight CMS to manage things like:
	•	Titles and metadata
	•	SEO-friendly URLs
	•	Post dates
	•	Images and embeds

Right now, all of that would require me to hand-edit markdown or .astro files, which is fine for a few pages—but not scalable.

The Ideal Stack (for Me)

What I’m envisioning is a lightweight CMS that layers neatly on top of GitHub. Something that lets me:
	1.	Write and edit posts in a simple UI
	2.	Automatically commit those changes to my GitHub repo
	3.	Trigger a redeploy via Cloudflare Pages, which I’m using for free hosting

That stack—Astro + GitHub + CMS + Cloudflare—is super lightweight, fast, and doesn’t cost a thing. Which, honestly, is a bonus. But more importantly, it aligns with how I want to run my business: minimal, efficient, and focused.

What’s Next?

I’m thinking of testing out a few CMS tools like:
	•	Netlify CMS
	•	Decap CMS
	•	CloudCannon
	•	Contentlayer (or possibly building something custom)

I’m also excited by the possibility of generating landing pages quickly using Astro templates and even ChatGPT to replicate layouts or image structures I like from other sites.

Final Thoughts

This post is more of a “thinking out loud” than a tutorial, but if you’re exploring Astro or looking for a low-cost, high-speed setup for content sites or landing pages, I think you’re on the right path. I’m encouraged by how quickly things are coming together—and I’m just getting started.

Thanks for reading! More soon.
